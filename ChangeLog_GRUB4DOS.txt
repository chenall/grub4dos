	boot record in the boot area of the NTFS partition.

2005-09-25 version 0.4.1pre28

	Fixed a bug reported by Gilles van Ruymbeke
	<gvr_no_spam_123@ruymbeke.com> <gvr_grub4dos123@ruymbeke.ch>:
	
	The map_func improperly opened the emulation image for 3 times, that
	might slow down the load speed heavily, especially for gzipped files.

2005-04-15 version 0.4.0
	Add /boot/grub/menu.lst in preset menu. This is final.

2005-04-07 version 0.4.0pre7

	not CHS-accessible.

	Fixed a bug reported by windrv: take too much time to check contiguity

2004-08-15 version 0.2.0pre11
	Mark the scdrom module as experimental.

2004-07-13 version 0.2.0pre9
	Merged GNU GRUB 0.95

	BOOTGRUB removed. Use BOOT.INI line C:\GRLDR="Start GRUB" instead.

	Patches from Gandalf: NTFS and ATAPI CDROM support(also thanks to

2004-04-12 version 0.2.0pre6
	Now GRUB.EXE can be used in CONFIG.SYS this way:

	shell=C:\some\where\grub.exe --config-file=(hd0,0)/boot/grub/menu.lst

	or

	shell=C:\some\where\grub.exe

	No other changes.

2004-04-09 version 0.2.0pre5
	Now BOOTGRUB contains 4 sectors, i.e., 2048 bytes. Optionally, you may
	copy the 2nd, 3rd and 4th sectors of BOOTGRUB to the three sectors that
	immediately follow the MBR. Also Optionally, you may copy 446 bytes
	from the very beginning of BOOTGRUB to the very beginning of MBR. In
	this way, the GRLDR can be started out of MBR, without the presence of
	NTLDR.

	CAUTION: Don't copy 512 bytes to MBR. The partition table should not
	be overwritten. The partition table is in the end of MBR. If you make
	a mistake, you will lose your whole system!!

2004-02-18 version 0.2.0pre4
	Arbitrary-size floppy and hard disk emulation finally implemented.
	GRUB for NTLDR is included. See README file.
	Splash image version is available in the SPLASH directory.
	
2003-09-23 version 0.1.4 -- development unstable release
	Unfortunately 0.1.3 has an ugly bug. Fixed.

2003-09-01 version 0.1.3 -- development unstable release
	Rewrite the code for guessing FreeDOS int vectors. Hopefully it works
	for all the future versions of FreeDOS :-)

2003-08-25 version 0.1.2 -- development unstable release
	Fixed a small bug that affects the read of the emulated floppy sectors.
	
	Added some files (including the menu.lst file) for installing GRUB to
	MBR from DOS. Usage:

	Copy the boot directory to C:\ ; You must do this on Windows, NOT dos,
	because DOS cannot deal with the long filenames.

	Run grub to access the menu.lst file in C:\boot\grub ; Of cause on DOS.

	When menu occurs, select a proper menu item for installing GRUB to MBR.

	If the menu does not appear, you should get the "grub>" prompt. At the
	prompt, type the following commands:

	grub> configfile (hd0,1)/boot/grub/menu.lst
	grub> configfile (hd0,2)/boot/grub/menu.lst
	grub> configfile (hd0,3)/boot/grub/menu.lst

	Then, the menu should occur.
	
2003-06-29 version 0.1.0.1 -- development unstable release
	Do some cleanups on 0.1.0, no important changes.
	BTW, it seems that the 0.1.0 is quite stable :-)
	
2003-06-29 version 0.0.8
	Restore mapped int13 to the unmapped state while grub is invoked
	after a previously performed drive map operation.

2003-05-29 version 0.1.0 -- development unstable release
	Floppy 1.44M drive emulation are OK. GOOD!!!! Usage:
	
	# boot Windows 98 SE
	map (hd1,0)/dos98se.img (fd0)
	chainloader (hd1,0)/dos98se.img
	rootnoverify (fd0)
	boot
	
	Another example:

	# boot Mandrake hard disk installer
	map (hd0,0)/hd.img (fd0)
	chainloader (hd0,0)/hd.img
	rootnoverify (fd0)
	boot

	Note that the floppy image file must size 1440KB, i.e., 1474560 bytes.
	_AND_ also, the file must consist of one contiguous disk area, no
	holes, no fragments. Use GRUB's blocklist command to determine whether
	or not an image file is contiguous. It is known that a 1440KB-file is
	always non-contiguous if it resides in an ext2 filesystem. But you may
	get a 1440KB contiguous file with an FAT32 partition(vfat filesystem).

	Floppy(and hard disk) with arbitrary sizes will be emulated in the
	future.

2003-05-06 version 0.0.7

		Fixed a huge bug!! Read the following carefully!
	
	Using the drive map command(just as many distributions currently do)
	
			map TO_DRIVE FROM_DRIVE
	
	to boot your system could seriously _damage_ your hard disk data,
	
	totally and thoroughly!! This bug has just been fixed in 0.0.7 :-)
	
	This bug is not specific to grub_for_dos, but caused by the original
	
	grub-0.93 release. So do _NOT_ use map command any more until my fix is

	accepted by GRUB maintainers or a similar fix is made by other
	
	people. For now, do _NOT_ use map command in any kind of Linux
	
	distributions such as Red Hat or Mandrake or any others.

		Because GRUB_FOR_DOS-0.0.7 already applied the fix, so it
	
	should be safe to use the map command.

		Another small bug was also fixed in grub_for_dos-0.0.7 :-)

2003-04-29 version 0.0.6
	Runs also on MS-DOS 3.30. No other changes.

	Runs on MS-DOS 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 6.20, 6.21, 6.22, 7.0, 7.10, 8.0 and
	FreeDOS(build 2029). GOOD!!

2003-04-20 version 0.0.4
	Running on FreeDOS(build 2029), GOOD!! (But currently GRUB.EXE only
	has limited FreeDOS support, maybe unstable.)

	Add a "Guess DOS Version" feature. The program now exit to DOS when
	guess failed. The previous versions of GRUB.EXE always hang when
	running on an unsupported DOS version.
	
2003-04-13 version 0.0.3
	The option "--config-file=FILE" was added.
	
2003-04-11 version 0.0.2
	Also runs on MS-DOS 8.0 (i.e., the DOS with WinMe/2000/XP), GOOD!!
	The GRUB.PIF file included, so GRUB.EXE can be started from Windows 9x

2003-04-10 version 0.0.1
	Runs on MS-DOS 7.10(Win98)
